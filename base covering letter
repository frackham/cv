To whom it may concern,
I would like to express my interest in the position of Graduate/Junior Application Administrator as advertised through Reed.
As a recent graduate with data management, software support, and administrative management experience, I believe I am a strong candidate for a position at the NCC Group.
You note that you are looking for someone with passion for technology, and the ability to get up to speed quickly. While studying for my Masters in Informatics, I had the opportunity to develop various software solutions using Python, SQL and .NET technologies. Similarly, I am self taught in VBA across the Microsoft Office suite, and have used this regularly within schools to automate both regular data processes and more bespoke projects.
I believe that my maturity, practical experience, and eagerness for a career change will make me an excellent candidate, with great potential to ‘develop’ over time. I would love to begin my career with your company, and am confident that I would be a positive addition to the NCC Group.
Please find my CV attached, and thank you for your time and consideration.
Your sincerely,
Fraser Rackham
