Skills
Communication
My previous positions required me to employ a range of speaking, presentation and training skills at both small meeting and a whole staff INSET level; including presentation and demonstration to SLT, middle leaders, teaching staff and lead OFSTED inspectors (in both of the last inspections I have been involved in). 
I have performed outreach work, most recently in supporting the data manager at a local ‘Requires Improvement’ school with a high proportion of disadvantaged students. This included presenting to the governing body of that school on how they could track student progress using transition matrices, and on the role of the data manager.
I have prepared written executive reports, including the collation of data and reports for OFSTED inspectors, governors and teachers. I have also undertaken copy-editing for a series of published fiction books and helped publish as eBooks.
I have presented to large (50+) audiences on technical/assessment content, most recently on tracking staff data skills at the Capita SIMS Partnership Conference (November 2015).

Data Management & Analysis
Implementation of whole-school student progress tracking. My previous school’s usage of data at the 2008 OFSTED was described as ‘reliable’, and inspectors noted that ‘improvement strategies emanate from accurate self-evaluation and systematic monitoring of progress’; systems that I designed and implemented in our MIS. This was further validated in the March 2013 inspection, where the school was judged to be Outstanding in all areas. 
Measurement of school and national policies, such as the impact of new KS4 accountability measures, on whole school areas ranging from timetabling and curriculum implications to in-year internal assessment.

ICT, IT and Computing
MSc Informatics developed research skills, programming in Python and software development methodology. Projects included collaborative website development and a summary of the current state of data visualisation approaches and techniques. I also experimented with HTML5, CSS  and jQuery to develop a local dashboard-style directory of school information, with toggleable colour-coding to indicate the status of the area. This includes some basic unit testing.
My MSc dissertation, “Proof of Concept for an Adaptable Analysis System for UK Secondary School Education”, built upon my Corporate Data & database Management module, using the Microsoft Scaling Framework to demonstrate how assessment analysis could be handled rapidly between schools at scale while still responding to rapid changes in national compliance requirements.
Knowledge of Microsoft Office suite (2003 – 2016 inclusive) to an extensive (and in some cases certified) level, including use of Word for referenced academic writing, reverse-engineering the Ofsted Inspection Dashboard in Excel, tracking emails through VBA in Outlook, and the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to create an assessment analysis application. I am currently writing a mail merge tool for PowerPoint VBA, and intend to release as Open Source on Github.
I have broad experience with a wide variety of software – from SPSS to text analysis tools – often self-taught at short notice to meet specific needs. This includes proprietary, open source, local and cloud-based applications, for academic, personal and professional purposes. Most recently, this included designing stationary for my wedding on Photoshop.
