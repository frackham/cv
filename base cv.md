Communication
My previous secondary data and leadership positions required me to employ a range of speaking, presentation and training skills at both small meeting and a whole staff INSET level; including presentation and demonstration to school leadership, governors, teaching staff and lead OFSTED inspectors (in both of the full inspections I have been involved in). 
I have performed outreach work, including supporting the data manager at a nearby ‘Requires Improvement’ school with a high proportion of disadvantaged students. This included presenting to the governing body of that school on how they could track student progress using transition matrices, and on the role of the data manager.
I have prepared written executive reports, including the collation of data and reports for OFSTED inspectors, governors and teachers. I have also undertaken copy-editing for a series of published fiction books and helped publish as eBooks.
I have presented to moderate (50+) audiences on technical/assessment content

Data Management & Analysis
Implementation of whole-school student progress tracking. My previous school’s usage of data was described by OFSTED as ‘reliable’, and inspectors noted that ‘improvement strategies emanate from accurate self-evaluation and systematic monitoring of progress’; systems that I designed and implemented in our MIS. I have also presented at the Capita SIMS national partnership conference on the use of data and systems to support the restructuring of non-teaching staff provision.
Measurement of school and national policies, such as the impact of new KS4 accountability measures, on whole school areas ranging from timetabling and curriculum implications to in-year internal assessment.

ICT, IT and Computing
MSc Informatics developed research skills, programming in Python and software development methodology. Projects included collaborative website development and a summary of the current state of data visualisation approaches and techniques. I also experimented with HTML5, CSS and jQuery to develop a local dashboard-style directory of school information, with toggleable colour-coding to indicate the status of the area. 
My MSc dissertation, “Proof of Concept for an Adaptable Analysis System for UK Secondary School Education”, built upon my Corporate Data & database Management module, using the Microsoft Scaling Framework and Google App Engine (Python) to demonstrate how assessment analysis could be handled rapidly between schools at scale while still responding to rapid changes in national compliance requirements.
Knowledge of Microsoft Office suite (2003 – 2016 inclusive) to an extensive (and in some cases certified) level, including use of Word for referenced academic writing, reverse-engineering the Ofsted Inspection Dashboard in Excel, tracking emails through VBA in Outlook, and the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to create an assessment analysis application.
I have broad experience with a wide variety of software – from SPSS to text analysis tools – often self-taught at short notice to meet specific needs. This includes proprietary and open source software, for academic, personal and professional purposes. Most recently, this included designing stationary for my wedding on Photoshop.
